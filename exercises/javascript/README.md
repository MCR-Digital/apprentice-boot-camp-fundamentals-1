## Setting Up

You will need npm and node v14.15.0 or later. There are many different ways to install it https://nodejs.dev/learn/how-to-install-nodejs

Windows setup instructions are here : https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-node-js-npm-on-windows

## Running tests

On the command line, navigate to this directory (`cd exercises/javascript`) and run `npm install` followed by `npm test`.

If you would like the tests to run continuously in watch mode, run `npm run test:watch`. To cancel watch mode, press `q` to quit.

If you have any problems, let one of the people running the boot camp know and we will happily help! :)
