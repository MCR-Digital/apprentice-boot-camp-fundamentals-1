## Setting up

If you don’t already have it, install Visual Studio Community. As part of the install, select `.NET desktop` as one of the install modules. If you’re limited for bandwidth then speak to one of us about what you can trim from the install. You only need .NET core packages and maybe the JIT debugger.

If you've already installed Visual Studio then make sure that `.NET desktop` is added through this menu:
`Tools --> Get tools and features --> .NET Desktop`

## Running the tests

Open this directory in Visual Studio and then open the appropriate solution file for each exercise. There is a test solution for each exercise, right click and `Run Tests`. The tests should all pass.

If you have any problems, let one of the people running the boot camp know and we will happily help! :)
