This is a briefing that can be shared with apprentices the week before the boot camp.

This is the first of your monthly two-day boot camps. We will be delivering the first three of your sessions, and then another one later on in the year.

This one will be focused on Object Orientated Development. We’ll be going through each of the four OO principles. For each we’ll try to explain our understanding of it, then you’ll work on an exercise to explore how you would apply the principle to an existing codebase. During the exercises, mentors will be on hand to help you with anything you get stuck on.

We have have one thing we want you to make sure you can do before Monday, and that is to be able to ***log in to your github.com account***. You’ll be using that account for most of your boot camps.

So, there isn’t much we want you to prepare this time, except yourselves. Have a restful weekend, get plenty of sleep and come with a curious mind on Monday. If you prefer to read a bit about things before learning about them, you could read an article like [this one](https://www.techtarget.com/searchapparchitecture/definition/object-oriented-programming-OOP).

We will be meeting in the event space of Manchester Digital for a 09:30 start. Please try to arrive by 09:15 to make sure you are ready, settled, have a drink etc. And you might even want to chat to each other and find out how you’ve been getting on at work.

See you on Monday!
