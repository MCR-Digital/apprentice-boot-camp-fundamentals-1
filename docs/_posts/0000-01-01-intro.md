## We want to hear from you

+ Don’t make us feel like [Professor Orth](https://www.msn.com/en-us/lifestyle/lifestyle-buzz/he-is-geppetto-73-year-old-unc-law-professor-goes-viral-after-recording-a-video-lecture-with-a-pinocchio-doll-sitting-in-the-front-row-because-he-didnt-want-to-teach-an-empty-class/ar-BB11E8UU)
+ Being remote makes it hard to check you are following
+ We’ll try to ask you questions to gauge understanding

Note: We miss doing this in person.  
  Much more engaging for all of us if it is two-way.

## Please interact with us

+ Have your camera on
+ Leave yourself muted unless you have something to say
+ Please feel free to ask a question verbally
+ You don’t need to raise your hand, but if you do we will try to notice and pause so you can talk
+ Hold down spacebar to temporarily unmute like a walkie-talkie
+ If you don’t want to speak up, ask in the #fundamentals-1-bootcamp Slack channel

Note: We prefer Slack as the messages will last a little longer  
If the question requires a detailed response  
If we don’t respond within a minute or so, we haven’t noticed
