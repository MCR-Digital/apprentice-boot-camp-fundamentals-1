## Encapsulation

+ Also known as data-hiding
+ How do we achieve it?
+ Why do we do it?

Note:
Prompt them for suggestions - the answer we're looking for is "by using objects".  

Naturally there are other language features which enable it but the concept of the
object is the main one.

We achieve ***encapsulation*** by wrapping
***state*** and ***behaviour*** inside objects

```text

                          ____Object____
                         |              |
          state ---------------->       |
          behaviour ------------>       |
                         |              |
                          -------------- 
                
```

### Why do we encapsulate things?

+ Organisation
+ Maintainability
+ Safety
+ Reuse


Note:

* Organisation of our code, smaller chunks are easier to understand - legibility
* Maintainability - we can change the internals without anyone else needing to know
* Safety - protecting access to data and behaviour - fewer bugs
* Reuse - our nicely packaged code is easier to use elsewhere

## Playing Card Example

<backgroundimage>{{ "/images/playing_cards.jpeg" | absolute_url }}</backgroundimage>
<backgroundimageopacity>0.20</backgroundimageopacity>

- Say we want to model a pack of playing cards
- And print them out in order
- There are four suits
- Cards have a value of ace through to king
- There are 4 * 13 = 52 cards in a pack

- Walk through the `Cards` class...

Note:
The code is not nice.  
We've chosen to model a playing card by two int values, one representing suit, one value.  
Therefore a pack is made up of an array of 52 pairs of int values - making a 2D array.  
It's probably best to walk through the current version of the code and make sure it's understood.  
It may be necessary to explain `switch` statements for example.  

--

### What's wrong with the current code?

+ There are numbers everywhere
+ Everyone knows everybody else's business

Note:
Get them to critique the existing code, see what they come up with - write up their answers somewhere and discuss.  
Note the error prone use of ints, and the fact that the Cards class knows how many cards are in a suit etc.

## Exercise incoming‚Ä¶

Throughout the boot camp, we have some good practices we want you to follow:

+ üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Run all of the tests when you start and after each change
+ üí• If you introduce a compilation failure, fix it before moving on
+ ‚úÖ When the tests pass, commit and say where you are up to in the message

Note: This will help you avoid getting into a mess and having to throw away lots of progress  

--

## Exercise (15 mins)

- What new classes would you introduce to better encapsulate the existing code? 

Note:
Get them to work in small groups.  
Once complete get them to describe their designs.  
Draw designs up at the front as they describe.  

--

## Exercise Review

+ How many classes did you come up with?
+ What were they?

Note: Conduct a straw poll and see how many classes they came up with.  
  See if there's any commonality, do they come up with the same names / concepts?  
  Obviously there are many possible answers.

### Possible solutions - 1

#### Java

```java
class Card {
    private int suit;
    private int value;
}
```

#### Javascript
```javascript
class Card {
    constructor(suit, value) {
        this.suit = suit;
        this.value = value;
    }
}
```

### Possible solutions - 3

#### Java

```java
class Card {
    private Suit suit;
    private int value;
}

class Suit {
    private String name;
}

class Deck {
    private Card[] cards;
}
```

Note:
Revisit this later - we can go even further if we bring in inheritance.

## Exercise - moving state (60mins)

* Create the following classes one by one
* The test should still pass

```text

                      ___PlayingCard___
                     | suit : int      |
                     | faceValue : int | 
                     |_________________|
                     
                      ______Suit_______
                     | name : String   |
                     |_________________|
                     
 *Once you've introduced Suit you'll need to change PlayingCard
                     
                      _PlayingCardDeck_
                     | cards : Card[]  |
                     |_________________|
```
