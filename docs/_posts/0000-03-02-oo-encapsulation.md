## Encapsulation

+ Also known as data-hiding
+ How do we achieve it?
+ Why do we do it?

Note:
Prompt them for suggestions - the answer we're looking for is "by using objects".  

Naturally there are other language features which enable it but the concept of the
object is the main one.

--

We achieve ***encapsulation*** by wrapping
***state*** and ***behaviour*** inside objects

    class Object {
        state
        behaviour()
    }
</mermaid>

### Why do we encapsulate things?

+ Organisation
+ Maintainability
+ Safety
+ Reuse

Note:

* Organisation of our code, smaller chunks are easier to understand - legibility
* Maintainability - we can change the internals without anyone else needing to know
* Safety - protecting access to data and behaviour - fewer bugs
* Reuse - our nicely packaged code is easier to use elsewhere

## Playing Card Example

<backgroundimage>{{ "/images/playing_cards.jpeg" | absolute_url }}</backgroundimage>
<backgroundimageopacity>0.20</backgroundimageopacity>

- Say we want to model a pack of playing cards
- And print them out in order
- There are four suits
- Cards have a value of ace through to king
- There are 4 * 13 = 52 cards in a pack

- Walk through the `Cards` class...

Note:
The code is not nice.  
We've chosen to model a playing card by two int values, one representing suit, one value.  
Therefore a pack is made up of an array of 52 pairs of int values - making a 2D array.  
It's probably best to walk through the current version of the code and make sure it's understood.  
It may be necessary to explain `switch` statements for example.  

--

### What's wrong with the current code?

+ There are numbers everywhere
+ Everyone knows everybody else's business

Note:
Get them to critique the existing code, see what they come up with - write up their answers somewhere and discuss.  
Note the error prone use of ints, and the fact that the Cards class knows how many cards are in a suit etc.

## Exercise incoming‚Ä¶

Throughout the boot camp, we have some good practices we want you to follow:

+ üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Run all of the tests when you start and after each change
+ üí• If you introduce a compilation failure, fix it before moving on
+ ‚úÖ When the tests pass, commit and say where you are up to in the message

Note: This will help you avoid getting into a mess and having to throw away lots of progress  

--

## Exercise (15 mins)

- What new classes would you introduce to better encapsulate the existing code? 
- What attributes do those classes have?
- Don't write any code - this is a pens and paper exercise

Note:
Get them to work in small groups.  
Once complete get them to describe their designs.  
Draw designs up at the front as they describe.  
Prompt them not to use inheritance at this stage.  

--

## Exercise Review

+ How many classes did you come up with?
+ What were they?
+ What were their attributes?

Note: Conduct a straw poll and see how many classes they came up with.  
  See if there's any commonality, do they come up with the same names / concepts?  
  Obviously there are many possible answers.

### One possible solution

<mermaid>
classDiagram
    class PlayingCard {
        Suit suit
        int faceValue
    }
    class Suit {
        String name
    }
    class PlayingCardDeck {
        PlayingCard[] cards
    }
</mermaid>

--

## Exercise - introduce a playing card (20mins)

* Create a playing card class
* Make the existing code use it
* The test should still pass

<mermaid>
classDiagram
    class PlayingCard {
        int suit
        int faceValue
    }
</mermaid>

--

## Exercise - introduce a suit (20mins)

* Create a suit class
* Make the existing code use it
* You'll need to change the playing card class to use it
* The test should still pass

<mermaid>
classDiagram
    PlayingCard *-- Suit : Composition
    class PlayingCard {
        Suit suit
        int faceValue
    }
    class Suit {
        String name
    }
</mermaid>

Note: The relationship shown here is composition. PlayingCard is composed of a Suit.

--

## Exercise - introduce a deck (20mins)

* Create a deck class
* Make the existing code use it
* The test should still pass

<mermaid>
classDiagram
    class PlayingCardDeck {
        Card[] cards
    }
</mermaid>

--

## Exercise - reflection

* How does our code compare to the original version?
* What's better?
* What's worse?

--

## A note on constructors

+ Constructors are special methods used to create new objects
+ They're especially useful to set properties which won't change or default values
+ Once an object is constructed it should be ready for action

--

### Exercise - constructors (15mins)

* If you haven't already, add constructors to your PlayingCard and PlayingCardDeck classes
* You shouldn't need to write new code, but simply shift existing logic into the constructors

<mermaid>
classDiagram
    PlayingCard
    class PlayingCard {
        Suit suit
        int faceValue
        PlayingCard(Suit suit, int faceValue)
    }
    class PlayingCardDeck {
        Card[] cards
        PlayingCardDeck()
    }
</mermaid>


--

### Behaviours

+ So far we have only moved state into classes - what about behaviours?
+ Each of our classes can be turned into a String so that we can show them to the user
+ Our classes should be able to provide a String representation of themselves
+ We can express this behaviour as a method on the classes

--

### Exercise - behaviours (20mins)

* Implement a method on your PlayingCard PlayingCardDeck and Suit classes which provides this String representation
* Again you shouldn't need to write new code, just move existing logic into these new methods

<mermaid>
classDiagram
    PlayingCard
    class PlayingCard {
        Suit suit
        int faceValue
        PlayingCard(Suit suit, int faceValue)
        toString() String
    }
    class PlayingCardDeck {
        Card[] cards
        PlayingCardDeck() 
        toString() String
    }
    class Suit {
        String name
        toString() String
    }
</mermaid>

Note: Point out that toString() is a Java convention, your language may be different

The test should still pass, make sure they actually call the new method

--

## Exercise - Reflection

* How does our code look now compared to the original?
