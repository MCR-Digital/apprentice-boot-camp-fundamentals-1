## Version Control

+ What is it?
    + A means of tracking changes to text
+ Why do we use it?
    + Audit trail
    + Archive
    + Versioning
    + Collaboration
    
Note:
Ask these questions to the group, get them to suggest answers and whiteboard them.
Summarise the points, with the aid of the bullet points.

_"If you're not using version control you're not writing software
you're just playing around."_

Note:
There is no attribution here, this is just me saying it but I don't think there are many professionals who would disagree.
Encourage them to use version control for everything, from the smallest of their pet projects.
If it's text check it in.
