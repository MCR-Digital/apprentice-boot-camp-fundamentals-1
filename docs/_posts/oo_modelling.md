### Mini-Auto Trader Scenario

<div  align='left' style="font-size: 24px; ">

<p>
Auto Trader is an organisation which advertises both new and used vehicles for sale.
Vehicles are advertised by both private individuals and dealers, and can be of many
different types, including cars, motorbikes and vans.
An advert, as displayed on the website, includes a price, a description, a make, a model and a registration.
</p>

<p>
In order to bill a customer for placing an advert their name and address must be stored.
Customers have the option of buying additional products to improve the quality of their adverts.
</p>

<p>
For example there is a product which changes the appearance of the advert to make it stand-out in the
search results by giving it a different background colour.
</p>

<p>
Any given vehicle can appear on multiple adverts, as they are also hosted on third-party websites
such as those run by car dealerships as well as other businesses.
</p>

<p>
Customers are billed every month, dealers are billed based on the products they have selected, whereas private individuals are billed for each individual advert.
