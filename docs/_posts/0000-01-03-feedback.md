## Feedback about this boot-camp last year

--

## Last year’s apprentices liked…

+ Being split into breakout rooms (Zoom)
+ Hearing that the OO principles overlap
+ Discussion around how to model objects
+ Recapping things from the getting started boot camp
+ Having access to language specific mentors knowledge
+ Learning from pair programming

## They said it would be better if

+ We didn’t repeat stuff from the boot camp
+ OO exercises were confusing—instructions weren’t clear
+ We covered more about how to do OO with JS in the main session
+ They didn’t have to read Alec’s handwriting
+ The examples were more relevant to JS
+ We provided solutions to the exercises
+ There was more time for the exercises
+ We showed them more about our thinking when solving problems
