\*[Van Roy](https://www.info.ucl.ac.be/~pvr/VanRoyChapter.pdf)

Note:
There are many different programming paradigms - take a moment to talk through the diagram.
From imperative languages such as C through Java and object-orientation through to functional.
Emphasise the distinction is fuzzy.
**Mention the "Turing Completeness" line.**

Note:
Alan Turing - who is he?
The notion of Turing Completeness and the fact that all the languages below the line on the previous slide have the same programming power.

## What are objects

* A combination of data and behaviour
* Just like in the real world

---

## A simple object-oriented modelling technique

For a given scenario:

* Nouns == Things == Objects
* Verbs == Doing Words == Methods

--

## Example

_The
<span class="fragment highlight-red" data-fragment-index="1">cat</span>
<span class="fragment highlight-blue" data-fragment-index="2">sat</span>
on the
<span class="fragment highlight-red" data-fragment-index="1">mat</span>_

<span class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" style="color:red">Classes: Cat, Mat</span>

<span class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" style="color:#1b91ff">Methods: sit</span>

--

## Enterprise Cat Application Using Blockchain Technology

```java
class Cat {
    void sit(){
        System.out.println("I'll sit when I'm good and ready.");
    }
}

class Mat {
    double width;
    double length;
    double height;
}
```

## Exercise (60mins)

Here's a simple description of an online car advertising business <a href="#/4/1">Mini AT Scenario</a>

Identify the following:

* The Objects
* Their attributes
* Their behaviours

## Exercise review (10mins)

What object oriented principles did we use in our design?

* Abstraction
* Encapsulation
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism

## Object-Oriented Concepts

<img src="{{ site.github.url }}/images/fourPillarsVenn.png" alt="Venn diagram of inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism and abstraction">

Note:
Needs a better diagram, but the point is here that these concepts are not distinct, there is often quite a lot of overlap between these language features.

---

## Encapsulation

<!-- TODO black box image here ?-->

-[+] Also known as data-hiding
-[+] How do we achieve it?

Note:
Prompt them for suggestions - the answer we're looking for is "by using objects".
Naturally there are other language features which enable it but the concept of the
object is the main one.

--

## Exercise (xx mins)

- Say we want to model a pack of playing cards
- And print them out in order
- There are four suits
- Cards have a value of ace through to king
- There are 4 * 13 = 52 cards in a pack

--

- Walk through the `Encapsulation` class...

Note:
The code is not nice.
We've chosen to model a playing card by two int values, one representing suit, one value.
Therefore a pack is made up of an array of 52 pairs of int values - making a 2D array.
It's probably best to walk through the current version of the code and make sure it's understood.
It may be necessary to explain `switch` statements for example.

--

### What's wrong with the current code?

-[+] There are numbers everywhere
-[+] Everyone knows everybody else's business

Note:
Get them to critique the existing code, see what they come up with - write up their answers somewhere and discuss.
Note the error prone use of ints, and the fact that the Encapsulation class knows how many cards are in a suit etc.

--

## Exercise (15 mins)

- What new classes would you introduce to better encapsulate the existing code? 

Note:
Get them to work in small groups and present back.

--

## Exercise Review

-[+] How many classes did you come up with?
-[+] What were they?

Note:
Conduct a straw poll and see how many classes they came up with.
See if there's any commonality, do they come up with the same names / concepts?
Obviously there are many possible answers.

--

### Possible solutions - 1

```java
class Card {
    private int suit;
    private int value;
}
```

--

### Possible solutions - 2

```java
class Card {
    private Suit suit;
    private int value;
}

class Suit {
    private String name;
}
```

--

### Possible solutions - 3

```java
class Card {
    private Suit suit;
    private int value;
}

class Suit {
    private String name;
}

class Deck {
    private Card[] cards;
}
```

Note:
Revisit this later - we can go even further if we bring in inheritance.
