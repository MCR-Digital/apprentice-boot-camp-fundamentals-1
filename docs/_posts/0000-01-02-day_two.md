So… Object Orientation makes your code good?

---

# Objects make sense in the real world

---

# Less so in software

Note:
  e.g. Car, Advert, Customer  
  Real life things
  No knowledge of databases etc.

---

## There are some principles to help!

---

## Single Responsibility Principle

Putting the ‘S’ in S.O.L.I.D.

Note:
  Single Responsibility
  Open / Closed Principle
  Liskov Substitution Principal
  Interface Segregation
  Dependency Injection

---

“every module or class should have responsibility over a single part of the functionality provided by the software, and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the class.”  
—[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle)

# Robert C Martin

(Uncle Bob)

Note:
  Co-author of the Agile Manifesto

---

“A class should have only one reason to change.”  
—Robert C Martin in ‘Agile Software Development, Principles, Patterns, and Practices’

---

# Good code is organised

Organisation more important as code base grows 

---

# Cohesion

“degree to which the elements inside a module belong together.”  
—Edward Yourdon & Larry L. Constantine in ‘Structured Design: Fundamentals of a Discipline of Computer Program and Systems Design’

Note:
  Cohesion is a good quality
  Code highly cohesive when single responsibility described in one place

---

# Classic Examples

Shout them out

-[+] Gaffa tape: stops things moving
-[+] Hammer: hammers things
-[+] Mug: holds liquid

---

# Classic Counter-Examples

-[+] Food processor: chops, mixes, whips, grates, slices
-[+] Swiss army knife: cuts, screws, unpicks, de-corks
-[+] Spork: cuts, spoons

---

# Consider Fizz Buzz…

How many responsibilities?

---

# What about a car?

-[+] Engine
-[+] Wheels
-[+] Indicators
-[+] Dashboard
-[+] Wipers
-[+] Radio
-[+] Seats
-[+] …

# Functional Decomposition

“… the process of taking a complex process and breaking it down into its smaller, simpler parts.”  
—[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/947874/what-is-functional-decomposition)

---

You can keep decomposing…

- Car
  - Dashboard
    - Speed indicator
      - Speedometer
        - Magnet
          - Atoms

… you probably shouldn’t though

---

When requirements change, should have one change to make

---

Stuff inside a class should change together

Stuff outside a class should change independently

---



---

(1 hour)

* Critique poorly implemented checkout kata
* Write their own <insert something moderately complex here>
* Single constructor

---

## DRY
(1 hour)

* Definition
* Change something which has duplication to suffer the pain
* Reflect on what we observed
* Talk about why duplication is bad
* Show examples of duplication
* Discuss why duplication happens
* Rewrite the thing they looked at before to remove duplication

---

## Retro/stand-up

---

## Red Green Refactor
(1 hour)

* Why do we write tests
* Why do we write tests first
* Why people might not write tests first
* Mention levels of testing (only covering unit testing in this boot camp)
* Introduce red green refactor and discuss why
  * Short feedback loops
  * Reduced context
  * Refactoring to make code betterer
* Show them the process (find a video or create some slides or do it live)

* Implement something like bowling kata or roman numerals kata (1 hour)
* Reflect on exercise
  * What did you like
  * What was hard

* Do the checkout kata with red green refactor (1 hour)
