<!--- ORGANISER THINGS TO CONSIDER 
- Which technical competencies, behaviours and knowledge module topics does the bootcamp cover/meet
- Structuring retros so that they can inform thinking for individual's personal learning records (off the job training record tab in their learning logs)
- Introducing some sort of test or quiz on basic concept learning points from the bootcamp to validate that they have taken stuff in, and provide organisation mentors with results to help them focus follow ups

# Fundamentals One Boot Camp

## Competencies, Behaviours and Knowledge units

* TC1 Logic: writes good quality code (logic) with sound syntax in at least one language 
* TC4 Test: can test code and analyse results to correct errors found using either V-model manual testing and/or using unit testing
* TC10 Can apply good practice approaches according to the relevant paradigm (for example object oriented, event driven or procedural)

## Resources Required

* Slides
* Laptops
* Internet access
* Post-its
* Markers
* A3 paper for apprentices to draw on
* Whiteboard (or flipcharts if this is not possible)

## Mentors / Languages
 
One mentor required per three apprentices (leads can act as mentors). These should be able to cover support for the required languages.

Several exercises (katas and code starters) will need to be ported to required languages if not already done.

## Prep-work for apprentices

None

## Follow-on tasks

Organisation mentors should look to exercise the knowledge we’ve covered in the boot camp. Below are suggestions for tasks that would do this, but please use your own judgement to work out what to do. There is no need for anything to be returned to MD or the presenters—it’s just a learning exercise.

* Draw a diagram showing how the classes interact in some code you have been working on
* They should identify Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism (this might require some discussion)
* Take a look at one of your codebases and find examples of classes with multiple responsibilities
* Try to improve some existing classes or methods with multiple responsibilities by using some of the OO principals
* Finish off the exercises started at the boot camp (checkout kata for example)
